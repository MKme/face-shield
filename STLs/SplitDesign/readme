These files are derived from Erik Cederberg's original design, Visor Frame North America Letter V3STL at https://www.youmagine.com/designs/protective-visor-by-3dverkstan
These STL files can be produced on 3D printers that have smaller build plates.

Print FaceSheildv3 Split NA(L).stl, FaceSheildv3 Split NA(R).stl and FaceSheildv3 Split NA(J).stl in ABS then use some ABS glue (acetone and ABS mix) to attach the Left and Right sections together with the Joiner.
